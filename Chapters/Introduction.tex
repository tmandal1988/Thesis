\section{Motivation and Literature Review}

Aerospace engineers before Wright brothers knew that airfoil shaped cross section of a wing will provide sufficient lift for flying heavier than air machines. However Wright brothers' breakthrough invention of 3-axis aircraft control made it possible for a human pilot to fly and steer the plane safely\cite{birthofflightcontrol}. Even today pilot vehicle interaction receives lot of attention during design phase to develop a safe and efficient Pilot Vehicle System (PVS). However it is difficult to forsee all the possible way human pilot can interact with an aircraft due to human pilot's high degree of variability, non-linearity and adaptibility. If not properly desgined and various handling issues regarding pilot vehicle interaction mitigated the PVS can lead to unstable conditions like Pilot Induced Oscillations (PIOs)\cite{McRuerPIO}. There has been several high profile PIO incidents\cite{SAABPIO}\cite{YF22} which emphasizes a need to better understand human pilot control characteristics as a part of overall PVS to reduce occurance of such incidents.Military Standard Flying Qualities of Piloted Aircraft (MIL-STD 1797A)\cite{MLSTD} defines PIO to be “sustained or uncontrollable oscillations resulting from efforts of the pilot to control the aircraft”. Also it has been observed that recent advances in digital fly-by-wire technology with augmented controls has led to an increase in PIO events\cite{BoeingPIO}\cite{Norton}\cite{hoh1982bandwidth}\cite{hess1991technique}\cite{green1986design}. The increasing complexity of digital fly-by-wire technology makes it  further difficult to fully understand the stability properties of the PVS under various circumstances. However since fly-by-wire technology is becoming increasingly complex in order to meet the control requirements of highly maneuverable military jets and the safety requirements of commercial aircraft, further research is needed to predict their effects on the PIO susceptibility of the aircraft and to develop techniques to mitigate this problem.Many factors affect the susceptibility of a PVS to PIO and to properly study PIOs it is important to classify and organize them. n the literature there are three commonly accepted categories of PIOs as outlined in a 1997 summary report by a National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Effects of Aircraft-Pilot Coupling on Flight Safety\cite{mcruer1997aviation}, which are;\\
\textbf{Category 1:} This category of PIO mainly deals with oscillations with an underlying linear cause like excessive
time delay, phase loss etc. Pilot behavior can be modeled as quasi-linear and time stationary\cite{mcruer1997aviation} . Category 1 PIO is the least common and easiest to understand. Several criteria focusing on excessive phase loss and time delay have been developed and compared\cite{moorhouse2000flight}\cite{liu2010prediction}\cite{garteur1999evaluation}. Certain criteria are based on open loop analysis like Bandwidth/Pitch rate overshoot criteria\cite{mitchell2004recommended} , while criteria like Neal-Smith\cite{neal1970flight} and Smith-Geddes\cite{smith1978effects}\cite{smith1995observations}\cite{mitchell1998critical}\cite{smith1979handling} are closed loop analysis with an assumed pilot model.\\
\textbf{Category 2:} This category of PIO is characterized by nonlinear events which can be modeled as Quasi-linear
events such as actuator rate limiting or amplitude limiting, etc. These are the most common type of PIO observed\cite{mcruer1997aviation} .
Most of the PIOs associated with non-linear events were found to be cliff-like that is the pilot reported the onset of
the PIO as sudden and unexpected. Since control surface actuator rate limiting is a common non-linearity associated
with modern flight control systems\cite{klyde2004investigating}\cite{duda1997prediction}\cite{amato2000analysis}\cite{hanke1995handling}, most of the studies are focused on studying its influence on aircraft handling quality and PIO. Currently, Open Loop Onset Point\cite{duda1997prediction} (OLOP) developed by Holger Duda at DLR is the only commonly accepted criterion\cite{moorhouse2000flight}\cite{garteur1999evaluation} for Category 2 PIO resulting from rate limited actuator in fully rate saturated case.\\
\textbf{Category 3:} This category of PIO is caused by highly nonlinear events which involves transition in the control
element of the aircraft or the human pilot behavioral dynamics. The PIOs associated with this category are also cliff-
like. This is difficult to recognize and is relatively rare, but could be highly dangerous when it does occur\cite{mcruer1997aviation}. Due to its highly complex nature there are not many effective tools to study Category 3 PIO . Unmanned aerial test bed can be useful in getting more flight data for Category 3 PIO as they are extremely dangerous to be studied on manned flight. These acquired flight data can then be used for modeling and simulation purposes.
